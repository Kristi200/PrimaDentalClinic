            "subDescription": "Implantology is a field of dentistry that deals with the placement of dental implants to replace missing teeth. Dental implants are metal structures (usually made of titanium) that are inserted into the jawbone to create a stable foundation for mounting crowns, which can be either removable or fixed prosthetics. The procedure for placing dental implants involves a series of steps.",
            "subDescription2": "Firstly, a comprehensive assessment of the tooth structure and jawbone of the patient is conducted. Then, the implant placement surgery is performed, where a metal post is inserted into the bone using specialized surgical techniques. After a healing period, during which the implant fuses with the bone, a customized crown (prosthetic tooth) is mounted onto the implant to create a perfect and stable solution.",
            "subDescription3": "Dental implants offer many advantages compared to traditional alternatives for filling gaps. They provide a more stable and long-lasting intervention, helping preserve the jawbone structure and improving the function and aesthetics of the teeth.",
            "subDescription4": "Additionally, they can prolong a patient's lifespan and enhance their quality of life by restoring proper oral function and improving aesthetic confidence.",

            "subDescription": "Milk teeth fillings are performed with different colors to make them more enjoyable for young patients, as well as protective fillings that release fluoride (sealants) to prevent tooth decay.

            "subDescription3": "Infection Treatment: An infected tooth should be treated immediately. Depending on the case, different treatments are followed to stop the infection, including antibiotic therapy, treatment, and filling of the canals.",
            "subDescription4": "Fluoridation: Periodically, every 3 to 6 months, for the protection of teeth against decay and to increase the strength of the tooth after its eruption. It is deposited on the tooth surface, making it more resistant to cavities.",
